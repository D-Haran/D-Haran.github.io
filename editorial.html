		<p>Decreation and sin is a very important topic in religion, in fact, I think it might even be the most important. How sin entered the world, and how it has affected everyone, is a very interesting concept in my opinion. I have always wondered what would happen if Adam and Eve didn't eat the forbidden fruit. Would they still get tempted into doing something else later, or would they stay pure in the Garden of Eden?

	   <p> The reason I think decreation and sin is a very interesting and important concept in the bible is because it is what creates the majority if not all of the stories in the bible. Sin is the reason God develops a further relationship with his people, therefore it is the root cause of destruction in the Bible. Although sin entered the world and created chaos, we have encountered many ways of learning from these sins too. When we learn from these mistakes we can become closer to God in faith.

		<p>Every person in the world has sinned, no one is perfect. The reason for this is because many people idolize worldly items, and make their own gods. This leads them to forget about the Lord our God and put these worldly temptations ahead of us. Just like what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden. However, we can repent in order to make up for our sins. The bible states in many passages that he loves when his children repent.
