		<p style="text-indent: 5%;">The movie "A Dog's Journey" is a great movie, it is very visible that the directors of this movie put a lot of thought in order to send a very meaningful message to its audience. This movie is a sequel to the movie "A Dog's Purpose". In "A Dog's Purpose, the main protagonist, Ethan, has a dog named Bailey. This dog sadly passes away and Ethan is very sad. However, Bailey, also encounters a think he's never even imagined before, he came back to life, except in a different body. he continues this cycle many times over and over again, his mission is to get back to his past owner, Ethan. Along the way of Bailey's mission, he meets many other great owners. At the end, of the movie, Bailey finally reunites with Ethan, At that time he was older than Bailey had seen him before. Ethan takes a while to figure out it’s him, he figures out when Bailey does a trick that Ethan taught him a long time ago. In "A Dog's Journey" Ethan understands that when Bailey dies, he comes back to life with another body. Ethan now has a wife, Hannah, and a granddaughter, C.J. As Bailey is about to die, Ethan tells Bailey to protect C.J no matter what. Bailey goes through the cycle many times in order to find his way back to C.J. Along Bailey’s journey, he meets many great owners such as a police officer. Bailey also learns how to detect cancer in one of his lives, C.J is now older and has a friend named Trent. After he finally reunites with C.J, he figures out that Trent- I think you should just watch the movie to find out the ending, until then, I'll leave you in suspense.

		The way Ethan trusts his dog, Bailey, to send a message to CJ and protect her, also relates to how God trust people of the world to send a message to other people of the world. Bailey is like a prophet sent from God, except in this movie, Bailey is sent by his previous owner, Ethan. Ethan sends Bailey in order to protect his granddaughter, CJ. An example of a prophet God sent to his people is Moses. Moses saved and protected the israelites from slavery. In conclusion, I believe this is a beautiful and interesting movie that you should watch. I would give this movie a ten out of ten because of the hard work and the amount of thought put into this movie, also because of the great movie concept.</p>
