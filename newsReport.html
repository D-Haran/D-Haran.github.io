		<hr>
	  <p>Armani Peerce, a well-known Hollywood actor, commits one of the sins, pride, in his latest when he shows off his new Mclaren P1 worth $7,300,000 USD. 3 days later,
	  on July 24th, 2020, Mr. Peerce crashed the valuable car on a freeway while speeding eighty miles over the limit. Mr. Peerce suffered many serious injuries. </p>

	 <p>This is only one example to show that worldly things that humans desire are never permanent. The Mclaren is one of the rarest cars on the planet, plated with pure gold rims and coated with exotic diamonds,   
	  it was sold to Mr. Peerce at an auction in Dubai. This news attracted the media’s attention and many of his fans didn’t like what he did and said that it was his fault for being too  
	  prideful, his career went downhill. He was not able to act because of the very critical condition he was in, he lost many of his fans, and this resulted in him being financially unstable. </p>

	  <p>This shows that being too prideful of worldly things is not fulfilling and can have negative consequences. Vince later apologized and said he did it because he idolized this car since  
	  he was a little kid and his excitement overcame him. One day later, Vince posted a video on his Instagram advising others watching not to get too prideful of your things. After a  
	  month of hospitalization, Vince was able to get back up on his feet and start acting again. Now, Mr. Peerce has learned his lesson and has recently been educating his fans on how  
	 to be humble, not prideful. </p>
